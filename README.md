Sudoku Solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Formulation

This module defines a SudokuCSP class that models a Sudoku puzzle as a CSP,
and provides both a basic backtracking solver and a smart backtracking solver
that incorporates heuristics like Minimum Remaining Values (MRV), Degree Heuristic,
Least Constraining Value (LCV), and Forward Checking (FC).

The module also includes functions to solve a Sudoku puzzle, print the board,
and run a main function that tests four puzzles (Easy, Medium, Hard, Evil) using
both solving strategies.

To Run the program use:
python sudoku.py
